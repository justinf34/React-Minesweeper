# React Minesweeper

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The goal of this app is to review React by implementing my own version of the Google Minesweeper game. The game engine is created by [Pavol Federl](pfederl@ucalgary.ca) and can be found in [Mineweeper Game Engine](https://repl.it/@pfederl/Minesweeper-Game-Engine#msgame.js).

## Quick start

1. **Running the game in you own computer**

   Navigate to the project root folder and start it up.

   ```shell
   cd <project-root>/
   npm i
   npm start
   ```

2. **Deploying to GitHub pages**

   [Deploying to GitHub Pages](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f) is an articles that explains how to deploy React apps intialized using `create-react-app` to GitHub pages.
